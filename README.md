# Path-to-master-Deep-Learning

Two approaches:
1. Top-down
2. Bottom-up

I feel a combination of top-down and bottom-up approach is advisable to master Deep Learning. The reasons are:
If you approach in bottom-up fashion, there are so many topics to master before mastering deep learning so at some point you may feel demotivated/bored to go ahead and give up in the middle.
If you approach in top-down fashion, you will not have the mathematical or the programming maturity to master Deep Learning.

So I suggest you follow a mixture of top-down and bottom-up approach to master Deep Learning.

Also make sure you have 1-2 years of programming experience in C/C++/Java/Python. 

Deep Learning/Machine has two components:
1. Theoretical concepts
2. Practical application concepts

Your approach to master Deep Learning should be a balance of Theoretical concepts and Practical application concepts. 

You need to have the following prerequisites to master Deep Learning. Try to complete them in order.

1. Programming - Python
2. Math - Linear Algebra
3. Math - Probability and Statistics
4. Programming - Data Analysis tools
5. Math - Machine Learning
6. Programming - Machine Learning
